1.   Big performance problem when loading revision information with a lot of differences made on the single file. (+)
	 *************************************************** TEST CASE EXAMPLES *****************************************
	 repo     :  googleurl 
	 revision :  100 
	 item     :  /trunk/src/url_canon_ip.cc
	 
	 Some fixes already made, but still need keep attention on preformance in such cases. The application is not enough fast.
	 May be we need some another control that supports text coloring, not RichTextBox
	 ****************************************************************************************************************
	 
	 
2.   If I add new repository to listen, it's on the new generated tab it's impossible to selected any ListView item, 
	 the object always return null. (+)
	 
3.   Raised processes management. Killing, stoping and notification about wat is going on now.(+)


4.   Faster and simplier management of the FlowDocument for Revision information window. (+)


5.  NotifyIcon implementation -> 
        a) Start application with notify icon (+)
        b) Implement commad s with simple fast conrol if the specified repository is out of date 
           SVN INFO WC s SVN INFO vs REPO (+)
        c) Implement window/control for notication to the user what repository need to be updated, and may be also 
           immediately update of the repository. (+)
           
           
6.   Change appearance of the ListView item: color of selected item on the list view, devide the same revision rows on in color groups
     in FlatView. (+-)
     ************************** COMMNETS **************************************
     Alternate color already implemented . Need of selected item nice color.
     **************************************************************************
     
     
7.   Group view implementation: Define group view template and interaction with the elements. Most probably it will be expander
     with the RevisionNumber, Account and Date info in the header. 
     
     
     
8.   Make critical tests: Aor example during updating remove network cable -> User shuld be notified about that. 
                          Or any kind of error message got from the SVN.exe must be visulaized or signalized to the user, 
                          in order to keep him updated with what is going on. User must have a control over situation.
     Load multiple revisons at a time. Don't wait until the process ends load the repository log information, begin immediately
     maddly click in order to see immediately the cnanges made on the selcted item.
	 
	 
9.   Double click between column on list view will cause strange behaviour on entire application. Need to figure out.
Fixed by disabling double click in between of the column' space

10. Put the program in autorun 

11. Add from the ContextMenu possibility to open file location

12.  Data virtualization for revision changes window, for the cases where large set of data was affected by the revision
we investigate.
